### This is a portfolio compiling all my work - from my postgraduate courses and self inititated learning. The following is description of each file, such that it is easier for the viewer to navigate.

#### Content:

#####  1. Heart Disease Prediction data 
________________________________________________________
  ##### *The above python code was used to build machine learning models in order to attain the best plausible prediction rates based on precision, recall and accuracy rates. Some of the models explored include - Decision Tree, XGB Classifier, Ada Boost, ANN (Artificial Neural Networks), Logistic Regression*

#### 2.  Damaged smartphone classification model 
____________________________________________________________
#### *For the purpose of image classification, the report utilised K-Means Clustering. Furthermore, this report utilised Transfer learning by installing a pre-trained model â€“ VGG16 - from the keras online library.By utilising a pretrained model, the report is able to leverage the predictive accuracy of a validated and seasoned model whilst saving both time and computational resources required to train a model from scratch* 


#### 3. Best-selling smartphone prediction model (Amazon data)
____________________________________________________________
#### *The code utilises Logistic Regression and Random Forest supervised learning models to determine relevant factors that contribute to increased demand for a certain produc*
